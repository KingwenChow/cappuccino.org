### Downloading & Running the Sample Application

If you haven't already, download the [Cappuccino Starter package](/downloads.html). This zip file includes a sample application (`NewApplication`), licensing info, a script you can run later to download
all the Cappuccino tools, and a README.

### Running NewApplication

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the Cappuccino Starter package, open
up the `NewApplication` folder, and locate the `index.html` file. Now,
simply open that file in your favorite web browser by double-clicking
it, or just by dragging it on top of your browser application. You
should end up with something that looks like this (in Safari):

![New Application running in Safari](/img/learn_img/new-app-running-safari.png)

<span class="label label-info">Info</span>  This will only work in some browsers. Normally you'll need to start a web server too. We'll update this section with more information soon.

### The Code

The source behind this sample application is startingly simple.
Although there are a few files, the only one we're interested in right
now is `AppController.j`. The others are necessary, but you don't need
to modify them to work on your application.

![AppController.j](/img/learn_img/new-app-appcontroller.png)

You can see in the image above that we have syntax highlighting in
TextMate. You can get this by installing the appropriate mode.

### Making a Simple Change

Now let's see what it takes to make a simple addition to NewApplication.
We'll add a button that toggles the text on the screen between "Hello
World!" and "Goodbye!". After the line that contains `[contentView
addSubview:label]` (line 31), add the following code snippet:

    :::objj
    var button = [[CPButton alloc] initWithFrame: CGRectMake(
                    CGRectGetWidth([contentView bounds])/2.0 - 40,
                    CGRectGetMaxY([label frame]) + 10,
                    80, 24
                 )];

    [button setAutoresizingMask:CPViewMinXMargin |
                                CPViewMaxXMargin |
                                CPViewMinYMargin |
                                CPViewMaxYMargin];

    [button setTitle:"swap"];

    [button setTarget:self];
    [button setAction:@selector(swap:)];

    [contentView addSubview:button];

Now, refresh your browser, and you should see a button right below
"Hello World!". It won't work just yet, because we haven't told it what
to do when the button is pressed. Before we do that, let's quickly go
over what each of the previous lines does:

    :::objj
    var button = [[CPButton alloc] initWithFrame: CGRectMake(
                    CGRectGetWidth([contentView bounds])/2.0 - 40,
                    CGRectGetMaxY([label frame]) + 10,
                    80, 24
                 )];

This line instantiates a new `CPButton` object, and places it 40 pixels to
the left of the center of its parent view, and 10 pixels below the
bottom of the label above it. It's 80 pixels wide, and 24 pixels tall.
`CGRectMake` is the main way to create a `CGRect`, which is the object
that describes the size and positioning of every view in Cappuccino.
`[contentView bounds]` returns the `CGRect`of `view`, but without its
positioning information. `[label frame]` return the `CGRect` of the label,
including its position information.

    :::objj
    [button setAutoresizingMask:CPViewMinXMargin |
                                CPViewMaxXMargin |
                                CPViewMinYMargin |
                                CPViewMaxYMargin];

Auto-resize flags define how a view resizes when its parent resizes
(all the way up to the window). In this case, it's saying that it would
like to have flexible space above, below, to the right, and to the left.
In other words, stay in the center, and don't change size.

    :::objj
    [button setTitle:"swap"];

Set the title of the button to "swap".

    :::objj
    [button setTarget:self];
    [button setAction:@selector(swap:)];

In Cappuccino, as in OpenStep and Cocoa, controls like buttons use the
target/action mechanism for defining their behavior. Think of this as
the equivalent to DOM elements' onclick, but much more powerful. In the
code above, we're setting `self` (the `AppController` instance) to be
our target, and `swap:` to be our action. This means that when the
button is pressed, we'll send the `swap:` message to `self`, which
would be equivalent to writing `[self swap:button]`. You'll notice
`swap:` takes one parameter. By default, actions usually have one
parameter, called `sender`, so that you can know who is requesting
this action take place (in this case it is the button). This can provide
useful context when multiple buttons or views have the same target and
action.

    :::objj
    [contentView addSubview:button];

Finally, in this last line, we add our button as a subview of the
window's content view. The content view is the root view of a window,
and so the first place you'd put any additional views.

As it currently stands, `label` is scoped to just exist within
`applicationDidFinishLaunching:`, which means it won't be accessible in
`swap:` or any other methods. So instead of making it a local variable,
lets make it an **instance variable** of `AppController`. To do this we
simply need to add it to our class declaration by replacing:

    :::objj
    @implementation AppController : CPObject
    {
    }

with:

    :::objj
    @implementation AppController : CPObject
    {
        CPTextField label;
    }

Now, let's take out the var keyword in the original declaration of
`label`.

    var label = [[CPTextField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMakeZero()];

becomes:

    label = [[CPTextField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMakeZero()];

Now we need to actually add the swap method. Add the following code
after the closing bracket of the `applicationDidFinishLaunching:`
method:

    - (void)swap:(id)sender
    {
        if ([label stringValue] == "Hello World!")
            [label setStringValue:"Goodbye!"];
        else
            [label setStringValue:"Hello World!"];
    }

This code checks what the current value of `label` is and uses that to
decide what to set the new value to.

Now you should be able to run this new code by saving `AppController.j`
and hitting refresh in your browser. Click the button, and you should
see the string change back and forth between "Hello World!" and
"Goodbye!".

For a finishing touch, add this line after you create the label in
`applicationDidFinishLaunching:`

    [label setAlignment:CPCenterTextAlignment];

Now the text will be centered as it toggles back and forth. For the
complete changes, you can download this copy of
[AppController.j](/learn/files/AppController.j).

### Wrapping Up

This concludes our quick introduction to the Cappuccino Starter package,
and to modifying your first application. Now that you've got your feet
wet, you can move on to a more advanced tutorial.
