The demos below provide full code samples for some simple Cappuccino apps. These demos favour function over beauty - we expect your apps to be much prettier.

To see more examples of Cappuccino apps, see the [current projects](https://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/wiki/Current-Projects) page for a sample of actual apps.
